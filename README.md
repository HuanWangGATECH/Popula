# Population_prediction_machine_learning_App

## Summary

Getting accurate population estimation down to county level is a crucial component of many decision making processes such as urban development, infectious disease containment, evacuation planning, risk management, conservation planning, and more. However, censuses survey at county-level is such an expensive and time-consuming process that alternative methods are investigated to estimate population at county level. In this project, we propose a machine learning pipline to make population estimations using data from various categories of a countyâ€™s characteristics ( county geographical land area, income per capita, and average life expectancy etc). We find our pipeline is able to predict county-level population data at an accuracy comparable to population projection data.
